## Decision Making Guidelines
- Donâ€™t just ask a question. Make the decision yourself, explain why. Then get feedback on the decision.
- If being wrong with the decision would waste more than 15 minutes, then wait for feedback. Otherwise, just pick what you think is the best, let us know, and continue on.
- Come up with workarounds while waiting on things if they are quick. For example, if you can create an account with your name and transfer ownership later on, then go ahead and do that.
